This extension needs an icon.png file (64x64 pixels recommended).
The icon should represent STEM teleportation - perhaps a combination of:
- A portal or teleportation symbol
- STEM elements (atom, gears, mathematical symbols, etc.)
- Minecraft-style pixelated design
- Green color scheme (#4CAF50) to match the extension color

You can create this icon using any image editor and save it as "icon.png" in this directory.
